Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
